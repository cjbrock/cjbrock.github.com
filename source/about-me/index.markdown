My name is [Corinna Brock](http://www.corinnabrock.com).  In my former lives, I have run the busiest bookstore in Boston, was an executive assistant to: a CFO of an alternative investments firm, a Vice-President of a medium-sized university, and a woman who used to sit on the Tennessee Supreme Court. Now, I am a computer programmer (no, really, I am).  I started programming recreationally five years ago, but in the last year it has become an obsession. I finally decided to make the leap into a career, not a hobby. I have completed [Avi Flombaum's](http://www.linkedin.com/in/aviflombaum) [Skillshare course in Ruby on Rails](http://www.skillshare.com/Become-a-Ruby-on-Rails-Developer-An-Intensive-5-Week-Course/962578898). I was also a first-cohort student at the [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com), called the "the Harvard Business School of coding" by [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/flatiron-school-coding-program-2013-4?op=1) magazine.

Specializing in back-end work with an eye towards design, I love both facets of programming. The compulsively organized side of me wants to solve the problem in the best way possible, but the creative side of me wants it to be aesthetically pleasing at the same time. Programming allows me to combine both passions into one. I also bring a history of executive assistance and event management to the table, giving me expertise in teamwork and customer service.

My languages include Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RubyMotion, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and jQuery.  I am also well versed in Git, CLI Basics, Server Setup, Databases, Deployment, Testing, Caching, and Security. Currently I am working with [Radio Systems Corporation](http://www.petsafe.net), flexing my newly developed PHP muscles and working with Magento and Expression Engine. I'm also their front-end ninja. 

In addition to design and programming, I enjoy reading, professional football, long distance cycling, and dancing. In my spare time you can find me rehabbing my investment properties with my favorite belt sander and paint roller, riding centuries on my Pinarello Galileo, or color-coding my shoe collection.

You can find me at many places on the internet. My personal site is [http://www.corinnabrock.com](http://www.corinnabrock.com). I'm on [Github](http://github.cjbrock.com), [Octopress](http://cjbrock.github.com), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cjnboston), [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=29204071), and [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/cjnboston/). A presentation that I gave on [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com) can be found on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/cjbrock/getting-started-with-ruby-koans).
