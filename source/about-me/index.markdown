My name is Corinna Brock.  In my former lives, I have run the busiest bookstore in Boston, was an executive assistant to a CFO, a Vice-President of a medium-sized university, and a woman who used to sit on the Tennessee Supreme Court. Now, I am a computer programmer (no, really, I am).  I started programming recreationally five years ago, but in the last year it has become an obsession. I finally decided to make the leap into a career, not a hobby. I have complete [Avi Flombaum's](http://www.linkedin.com/in/aviflombaum) [Skillshare course in Ruby on Rails](http://www.skillshare.com/Become-a-Ruby-on-Rails-Developer-An-Intensive-5-Week-Course/962578898), and I'm currently a student at the [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com).

Specializing in back-end work with an eye towards design, I love both facets of programming. The compulsively organized side of me wants to solve the problem in the best way possible, but the creative side of me wants it to be aesthetically pleasing at the same time. Programming allows me to combine both passions into one. I also bring a history of executive assistance to the table, giving me expertise in teamwork and customer service.

My languages include Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RubyMotion, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and jQuery.  Currently at the Flatiron school I am working to become well versed in Git, CLI Basics, Server Setup, Databases, Deployment, Testing, Caching, and Security.

In addition to design and programming, I enjoy reading, professional football, long distance cycling, dancing, and relaxing on the couch after climbing up the five flights of stairs to my apartment.
