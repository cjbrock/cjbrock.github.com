## Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto
{% blockquote Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto LINK TITLE %}
I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.
{% endblockquote %}
Matz(LINK) is a Japanese computer programmer and the creator of Ruby. Empahsizing feeling rather than perfection, he released Ruby in December of 1995 as a productive language that was still fun to use. Ruby is said to follow the principle of least astonishment (at least for Matz), meaning that the language should behave in such a way as to minimize confusion for experienced users. 
Now working as the chief architect of Heroku(LINK), he is currently working on a new open-source Ruby project called mruby(LINK).  

The general Ruby community lives by the mantra: /"Matz is nice, so we are nice"/

## _why the lucky stiff
{% blockquote _why the lucky stiff LINK TITLE %}
When you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow & exclude people. So create.

## David Heinemeier Hansson
{% blockquote David Heinemeier Hansson LINK TITLE %}
Flexibility is not free. It’s overrated. And if you trade that flexibility in for some constraints, you get a lot of complexity removed from the equation, you get a lot of productivity back from all the stuff you don’t have to do.
{% endblockquote %}
Hansson is a Danish programmer who created Ruby on Rails, a web framework that is optimized for programmer productivity.  It abstracts away a lot of code processes, leading some to criticize the "magic" of rails(LINK). However, Rails allows programmers to hit a high level of productivity faster with a less steep learning curve than other languages. Hansson is also a professional race car driver(LINK). 

## Bret Victor

The True Way transcends the minutia of skill. There is no "Technology." There is no "Design". There is only a vision of how mankind should be, and the relentless resolve to make it so. The rest is details.
{% endblockquote %}
Probably the most well known for creating the technology that allows you to swipe between screens on your iPhone, Bret Victor(LINK) is an educator located in Silicon Valley. He strives to revolutionize the way people learn to program. He is also exploring the notions of dynamic pictures(LINK) and Substroke(LINK).
