Last night I gave my first [Ruby presentation](http://vimeo.com/51753999) to [NYC on Rails](http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/).  

{% vimeo 51753999 %}

I chose to present on the [Ruby Koans](http://cjbrock.github.com/blog/2012/10/10/5-easy-steps-to-getting-started-with-ruby-koans/): how to get started, and my favorite asserts.
