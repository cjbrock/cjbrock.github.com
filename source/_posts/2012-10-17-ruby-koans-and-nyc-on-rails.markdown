Last night I gave my first [Ruby presentation](http://vimeo.com/51753999) to [NYC on Rails](http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/).

I chose to present on the [Ruby Koans](http://cjbrock.github.com/blog/2012/10/10/5-easy-steps-to-getting-started-with-ruby-koans/): how to get started, and my favorite asserts. Video is available on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/51753999), and you can check out my enhanced presentation with the examples in slide on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/u/cjbrock/p/getting-started-with-ruby-koans).
