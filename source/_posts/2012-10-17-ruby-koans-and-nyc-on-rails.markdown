Last night I gave my first [Ruby presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/u/cjbrock/p/getting-started-with-ruby-koans) to [NYC on Rails](http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/).  I chose to present on the [Ruby Koans](http://cjbrock.github.com/blog/2012/10/10/5-easy-steps-to-getting-started-with-ruby-koans/): how to get started, and my favorite asserts. Video will be available shortly, but in the meantime check out my presentation on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/u/cjbrock/p/getting-started-with-ruby-koans).
